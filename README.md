# fastapi-job-board

I build a job board website, In which we will be having:

    List a job
    Details of the Job post
    Create a job post
    Update the job
    Delete the job
    Permissions (Authorization required, only superuser and the original author can delete)
    Authentication ( Registration and Login )
    Test our Endpoints
    Test Coverage
    Webapp for Jobboard

I follow something called Test-Driven Development in which we will be creating a unit-test for each of the components.
